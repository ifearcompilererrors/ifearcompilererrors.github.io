        Angelique De Castro
      </h1>
      <h2>Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Angelique De Castro (she/they) is a visual artistic technologist crafting stories and experiences that center marginalized narratives. Their collaborative art practice examines the archival qualities of the digital and corporeal by drawing upon personal family history and that of their collaborators. The resulting im/mobile sculptures promote cultural narratives that investigate notions of belonging, identity, and interiority of a generation raised throughout the precipice of the Digital Age. She typically co-creates with other artists whose practices are socially engaged or whose presence in their medium is underrepresented.

      <p>
        They are also a Senior Software Engineer at The New York Times engineering reader and editorial-facing news products.
